'Cause I'm not fine at all [Chorus: All, Luke ] I remember the day you told me you were leavin' I remember the make-up running down your face And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape 'Cause I'm not fine at all [Verse 2: Calum, Calum & Luke ] The pictures that you sent me, they're still livin' in my phone I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long  It's like we never happened, was it just a lie? If what we had was real, how could you be fine? 'Cause I'm not fine at all I remember the day you told me you were leavin' I remember the make-up running down your face And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape [Bridge: Luke & Ashton, Luke ] If today I woke up with you right beside me Like all of this was just some twisted dream I'd hold you closer than I ever did before And you'd never slip away And you'd never hear me say [Chorus: All, Luke ] I remember the day you told me you were leavin' I remember the make-up running down your face And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape 'Cause I'm not fine at all  No, I'm really not fine at all Tell me this is just a dream 'Cause I'm really not fine at all"
