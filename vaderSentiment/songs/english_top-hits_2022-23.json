Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment  Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise Mama's gon' be alright And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'ma give you the world I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

You go down just like Holy Mary, Mary on a, Mary on a cross Your beauty never ever scared me, Mary on a, Mary on a cross If you choose to run away with me, I will tickle you internally And I see nothing wrong with that (Mary on a, Mary on a cross) Nothing wrong with that (Mary on a, Mary on a cross) Nothing wrong with that (Mary on a, Mary on a cross) (Mary on a) Mary on a cross"
