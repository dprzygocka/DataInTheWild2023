mtv raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like ice-t and n.w.a were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  while rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the billboard’s hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. from salt-n-pepa to macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100. \"all of the lights\" - kanye west 99. \"no lie\" - 2 chainz feat. drake 98. \"aston martin music\" - rick ross feat. drake & chrisette michelle 97. \"loungin\" - ll cool j 96. \"o.p.p.\" - naughty by nature 95. \"heartless\" - kanye west 94. \"player's ball\" - outkast 93. \"holla holla\" - ja rule 92. \"left/right\" - drama 91. \"call me d-nice\" - d-nice 90. \"c'mon n' ride it (the train)\" - quad city dj's 89. \"looking at the front door\" - main source 88. \"money maker\" - ludacris feat. pharrell 87. \"the way you move\" - outkast feat. sleepy brown 86. \"jigga my n****\" - jay z 85. \"slow motion\" - juvenile feat. soulja slim 84. \"headlines\" - drake 83. \"got money\" - lil wayne feat. t-pain 82. \"my baby\" - lil' romeo 81. \"lovers & friends\" - lil jon & the east side boyz feat. usher & ludacris 80. \"damn!\" - youngbloodz feat. lil jon 79. \"whistle while you twurk\" - ying yang twins 78. \"(hot s**t) country grammar\" - nelly 77. \"crank that (soulja boy)\" - soulja boy tellem 76. \"jump\" - kriss kross 75. \"po pimp\" - do or die feat. twista 74. \"dunkie butt (please please please) - 12 guage 73. \"lights, camera, action!\" - mr. cheeks 72. \"i'll do 4 u\" - father m.c 71. \"lookin' at me\" - mase feat. puff daddy 70. \"independent\" - webbie feat. lil' phat & lil' boosie 69. \"drank in my cup\" - kirko bangz 68. \"4, 5, 6\" - sole feat. jt money & kandi 67. \"it ain't my fault 2/somebody like me\" - silkk the shocker feat. mystikal 66. \"funkdafied\" - da brat 65. \"rump shaker\" - wreckx-n-effect 64. \"around the way girl\" - ll cool j 63. \"callin' me\" - lil' zane feat. 112 62. \"mind playing tricks on me\" - geto boys 61. \"work it\" - missy \"misdemeanor\" elliot 60. \"dilemma\" - nelly feat. kelly rowland 59. \"get money\" - junior m.a.f.i.a 58. \"lean wit it, rock wit it\" - dem franchize boyz feat. lil peanut & charlay 57. \"i got 5 on it\" - luniz 56. \"they want efx\" - das efx 55. \"ghetto cowboy\" - mo thugs family feat. bone thugs-n-harmony 54. \"raise up\" - petey pablo 53. \"it's goin' down\" - young joc 52. \"empire state of mind\" - jay z & alicia keys 51. \"da' dip\" - freak nasty 50. \"good life\" - kanye west feat. t-pain 49. \"bounce with me\" - lil bow wow feat. xscape 48. \"moment 4 life\" - nicki minaj feat. drake 47. \"walk it out\" - unk 46. \"nothin' on you\" - b.o.b feat. bruno mars 45. \"dead and gone\" - t.i. feat. justin timberlake 44. \"no time\" - lil' kim feat. puff daddy 43. \"right thurr\" - chingy 42. \"gangnam style\" - psy 41. \"i'll be missing you\" - puff daddy & faith evans feat. 1121 40. \"déjà vu (uptown baby)\" - lord tariq & peter gunz 39. \"bedrock\" - young money feat. lloyd 38. \"lollipop\" - lil wayne feat. static major 37. \"in da club\" - 50 cent 36. \"who dat\" - jt money feat. sole 35. \"one more chance/stay with me\" - the notorious b.i.g 34. \"knockin' boots\" - candyman 33. \"up jumps da boogie\" - magoo and timbaland 32. \"i want it all\" - warren g. feat. mack 10 31. \"treat 'em right\" - chubb rock 30. \"i like dem girlz\" - lil jon & the east side boyz 29. \"dansin wit wolvez\" - strik 9ine 28. \"me so horny\" - 2 live crew 27. \"live your life\" - t.i. feat. rihanna 26. \"look at me now\" - chris brown feat. lil wayne & busta rhymes 25. \"holy grail\" - jay z feat. justin timberlake 24. \"i'm on one\" - dj khaled feat. drake, rick ross & lil wayne 23. \"get low\" - lil jon & the east side boyz feat. ying yang twins 22. \"cross the border\" - philly's most wanted 21. \"drop it like it's hot\" - snoop dogg feat. pharrell 20. \"lean back\" - terror squad 19. \"the phuncky feel one/how i could...\" - cypress hill 18. \"ni**as in paris\" - jay z, kanye west 17. \"mercy\" - kanye west, big sean, pusha t, 2 chainz 16. \"can't nobody hold me down\" - puff daddy feat. mase 15. \"how do u want it/california love\" - 2pac feat. k-ci and jojo 14. \"best i ever had\" - drake 13. \"whatever you like\" - t.i 12. \"low\" - flo rida feat. t-pain 11. \"the motto\" - drake feat. lil wayne 10. \"the humpty dance\" - digital underground 9. \"no hands\" - waka flocka flame feat. roscoe dash & wale 8. \"big poppa/warning\" - the notorious b.i.g 7. \"flava in ya ear\" - craig mack 6. \"gangsta's paradise\" - coolio feat. l.v 5. \"expression\" - salt-n-pepa 4. \"can't hold us\" - macklemore & ryan lewis feat. ray dalton 3. \"hot boyz\" - missy \"misdemeanor\" elliot feat. nas, eve, & q-tip 2. \"tootsee roll\" - 69 boyz 1. \"thrift shop\" - macklemore & ryan lewis feat. wanzyou might also likeembed"
