Boy chase a bird, so close but every time He’ll never catch her, but he can’t stop trying Funny the way it is, and if you think about it One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out Funny the way it is, not right or wrong On a soldier’s last breath his baby’s being born Funny the way it is, not right or wrong Somebody’s broken heart becomes your favorite song Funny the way it is, and if you think about it One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out Standing on a bridge, watch the water passing under me It must’ve been much harder when there was no bridge, just water Now the world is small, compared to how it used to be With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars"

Does the pain weigh out the pride And you look for a place to hide? Did someone break your heart inside? You're in ruins One, twenty-one guns Lay down your arms, give up the fight One, twenty-one guns Throw up your arms, into the sky You and I When you're at the end of the road And you lost all sense of control And your thoughts have taken their toll When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul Your faith walks on broken glass And the hangover doesn't pass Nothing's ever built to last You're in ruins  One, twenty-one guns Lay down your arms, give up the fight One, twenty-one guns Throw up your arms, into the sky You and I Did you try to live on your own When you burned down the house and home? Did you stand too close to the fire Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone? When it's time to live and let die And you can't get another try Somethin' inside this heart has died You're in ruins One, twenty-one guns Lay down your arms, give up the fight One, twenty-one guns Throw up your arms, into the sky One, twenty-one guns Lay down your arms, give up the fight One, twenty-one guns Throw up your arms, into the sky You and I"

(Yeah) Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah) Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah) Lack of understanding leading us away from unity That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found Now ask yourself  Where is the love?

If you want more love Why don't you say so? Drop his name Push it in and twist the knife again Watch my face As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain  Clouds of sulfur in the air Bombs are falling everywhere It's heartbreak warfare Once you want it to begin No one really ever wins In heartbreak warfare If you want more love Why don't you say so? If you want more love Why don't you say so? Just say so How come the only way to know how high you get me Is to see how far I fall? God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me But I can't break through it all It's a heart, heartbreak I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight Let's just fix this whole thing now I swear to God we're gonna get it right If you lay your weapon down  Red wine and Ambien You're talking shit again It's heartbreak warfare Good to know it's all a game Disappointment has a name It's heartbreak, heartbreak It's heartbreak warfare It's heartbreak warfare It's heartbreak warfare"
