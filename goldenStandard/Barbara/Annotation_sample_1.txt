Name: Chasing Cars
Artist: Snow Patrol
Lyrics:
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

Let's waste time
Chasin' cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Item 5:
Mood: Negative
Name: If I Lose Myself
Artist: OneRepublic
Lyrics:
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?
They're trying to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'm gonna run 'til you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, you don't need
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
I've become what I can't be
Oh, do you see what I see?

Lyrics:
The lights go out, and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singin'
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waitin' to be tamed, singin'
You are
You are
Confusion never stops
Closin' walls and tickin' clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singin'
Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'
You are
You are
You are
You are

You are
You are

My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?

Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones
Playin' with a stick of dynamitе
There was nevеr gray in black and white
There was never wrong 'til there was right (Ooh-ooh)
Feelin' like a boulder hurtlin'
Seein' all the vultures circlin'
Burnin' in the flames, I'm workin' in
Turnin' in a bed, that's darkenin'

My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (In my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones
'Cause there's magic in my bones
Look in the mirror of my mind
Turnin' the pages of my life
Walkin' the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leavin' the ones that never cared
Pickin' the pieces up and buildin' to the sky
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?

I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (Magic in my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (Soul)
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones
There goes my mind, (I-I-I) don't mind
There goes my mind (There it goes, there it goes)
There goes my mind, (I-I-I) don't mind
There goes my mind (There it goes)

Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT

You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me

Artist: Ryan Cabrera
Lyrics:
Four years later
Time goes by fast
Got my memories
And they will last
I try to keep it simple 'cause I hate goodbye's
I try to keep it simple by telling myself that
I, I will remember you
And all of the things that we've gone through
There is so much I could say
But words get in the way so
We're not together
I will remember you
We're a picture in my mind
And when I wanna find you
I just close my eyes
You'll never be that far from me
So don't say goodbye 'cause
You'll never be that far from me
I'm telling myself that
I, I will remember you
And all of the things that we've gone through
There is so much I could say
But words get in the way so
We're not together
I will remember you

You were there when I needed a friend
Thank you, thank you
I never told you how much that meant
God thank you, thank you
I will remember you
And all of the things that we've gone through
There is so much I could say
But words get in the way so
I, I will remember you
And all of the things that we've gone through

There is so much I could say
But words get in the way so
We're not together
I will remember

Don't try to change it now sayin' you gotta bounce (Bounce)
When two seconds ago said you just got in the house (The house)
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself (By yourself)
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else

Gettin' caught up in your game when you cannot say my name

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS
Like a bitch, I would know
And you overthink
Always speak
cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know)
That you're not gonna change
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down (Down)

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot, then you're cold (Oh-oh-oh)
You're yes, then you're no

So I tried to be like you
And I got swept away
I didn't know that it was so cold
And you needed someone to show you the way
So I took your hand and we figured out that
When the tide comes, I'd take you away
If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares
I'm sinking slowly
So hurry, hold me
Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on
Please, can you tell me?
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone

If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there

All you wanted was somebody who cares
If you need me, you know I'll be there

I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who else)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, "I only think of you"
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart
I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)
(We belong together)
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
(We belong together) (Who will?)
When you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)
It's still so hard to believe (Who will?)
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
(Who will? Who will? Who will?)
We belong together

Lyrics:
I don't know but I think I may be fallin' for you
Droppin' so quickly
Maybe I should keep this to myself
Wait until I know you better
I am trying, not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
And so I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head
I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
As I'm standing here
And you hold my hand
Pull me towards you
And we start to dance
All around us
I see nobody
Here in silence
It's just you and me

I'm trying, not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
And so I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head
I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
Oh, I just can't take it
My heart is racing
The emotions keep spinning out
I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

I think I'm fallin' for you
I can't stop thinking 'bout it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you
I can't stop thinking 'bout it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead

Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss

While he's havin' a smoke and she's takin' a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touchin' his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killin' me

Jealousy, turnin' saints into the sea
Swimmin' through sick lullabies
Chokin' on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay

But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)

But "got it" just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all (Ah!)
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance

[Verse 1: Harry &
Liam

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone
[Pre-Chorus: Zayn &
All
]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight (
Oh-oh-oh
)
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (
Oh-oh-oh
)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (
Oh-oh-oh
)
With nothing in between
[Chorus: Harry &
All
]
The story of my life,
I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time
is frozen
(
The story of, the story of
)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life
(
The story of, the story of

[Verse 2: Niall &
Liam
]
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

[Pre-Chorus: Louis,

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (

The fire beneath my feet is burning bright (

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time

The story of, the story of

The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life
(
The story of, the story of

And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you
Is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen

The story of my life, I give her hope (

I spend her love until she's broke inside (

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do

Lyrics:
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

Lyrics:
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, "Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely"
And ever since that day
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
"Run, run Lost Boy," they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
"Run, run Lost Boy," they say to me

And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook
Neverland, I love you so, you are now my home sweet home
Forever a Lost Boy at last
And for always I will say...

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am &
Fergie
]
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am &
Fergie
]
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
[Outro: will.i.am &

Now sing with me, y'all
(One world, one world)
We only got
(One world, one world)
That's all we got
(One world, one world)
And something's wrong with it
(Yeah)
Something's wrong with it
(Yeah)
Something's wrong with the w-world, world, yeah
We only got
(One world, one world)
That's all we got
(One world, one world)

Name: High Enough
Artist: K.Flay
Lyrics:
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
I don't like anyone better than you, it's true
I'd crawl a mile in a desolate place with the snakes just for you
Oh, I'm an animal, hand me a tramadol, gimme the juice
You are my citadel, you are my wishing well, my baby blue
I used to like liquor to get me inspired
But you look so beautiful, my new supplier
I used to like smoking to stop all the thinking
But I found a different buzz
The world is a curse, it'll kill if you let it
I know they got pills that can help you forget it
They bottle it, call it medicine
But I don't need drugs
'Cause I'm already high enough
You got me, you got me good
I'm already high enough
I only, I only, I only got eyes for you

Do you see anyone other than me? Baby, please
I'll take a hit of whatever you got, maybe two, maybe three
Oh, you're phenomenal, feel like a domino, fall to my knees
I am a malady, you are my galaxy, my sweet relief
I used to like liquor to get me inspired
But you look so beautiful, my new supplier
I used to like smoking to stop all the thinking
But I found a different buzz
The world is a curse, it'll kill if you let it
I know they got pills that can help you forget it
They bottle it, call it medicine
But I don't need drugs
'Cause I'm already high enough
You got me, you got me good
I'm already high enough
I only, I only, I only got eyes for you
(Oh)
Don't try to give me cold water
I don't wanna sober up
All I see are tomorrows
Oh, the stars were made for us

I'm already high enough
You got me, you got me good
I'm already high enough
I only, I only, I only got eyes for you
(Oh)
(I only got eyes for you)
(Oh, oh)
(I only, I only, I only got eyes for you)

Name: Miss You
Artist: Oliver Tree & Robin Schulz
Lyrics:
Don't remind me
I'm mindin' my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care?
If you really don't like me
Find somebody else, it could be anyone else out there
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I nеver wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen ovеr and over again
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'

Don't remind me
I'm mindin' my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care?
If you really don't like me
Find somebody else, it could be anyone else out there
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'

Item 36:
Mood: Negative
Name: Love Yourself
Artist: Justin Bieber
Lyrics:
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Name: Crystal Ball
Artist: Keane
Lyrics:
Who is the man I see
Where I'm supposed to be?
I lost my heart
,
I buried it too deep
Under the iron sea
Oh, crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Lines ever more unclear
Not sure I'm even here
The more I look, the more I think that I'm
Starting to disappear
Oh, crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Oh, crystal ball hear my song
I'm fading out
Everything I know is wrong
So put me where I belong

I don't know where I am
And I don't really care
I look myself in the eye
There's no one there
I fall upon the earth
I call upon the air
But all I get is the same old vacant stare
Oh, crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Oh, crystal ball hear my song
I'm fading out
Everything I know is wrong
So put me where I belong
