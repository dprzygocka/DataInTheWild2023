Artist: Hinder
Lyrics:
Honey, why you callin’ me so late?
It’s kinda hard to talk right now
Honey, why you cryin’? Is everything okay?
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud
Oh, well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
It‘s funny that you're callin' me tonight
And yes, I've dreamt of you too
Does he know you're talkin’ to me
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think she has a clue

Oh, well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
It's really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
(Never wanna say goodbye)
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

Honey, why you callin’ me so late?

Name: The Monster
Artist: Eminem
Lyrics:
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of
Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see,
but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(
New-ooh, ooh-ooh
) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head,
keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MCs, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that

Remember me when you're the one you always dreamed
Remember me whenever noses start to bleed
Remember me, special needs

I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior
Remember me when you clinch your movie deal
And think of me stuck in my chair that has four wheels
Remember me through
flash photography and screams
Remember me, special dreams
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever gettin' older
We ain't ever gettin' older
We ain't ever gettin' older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you

It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you

It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hangin'
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread (Breakable thread)
You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be
You were everything, everything
That I wanted (That I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it (We lost it)
And all of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time, you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say (I know what they say)
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they (But so are they)

Do they even know you? (Even know you)
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do (All the shit that you do)
You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be
You were everything, everything
That I wanted (That I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it (We lost it)
And all of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time, you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you care
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done
He was everything, everything

We were meant to be, supposed to be

'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

It's been months
And for some reason I just (Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah (Enough is enough)
No more walking 'round with my head down (Yeah)

Cryin' over you

So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be
That's the reason
I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Oh, leave me alone) Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs) Oh-oh, hey
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs (Hey), so tired of tears (So tired of tears)
So done with wishin' she were still here (Oh)
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Ooh, oh)

Lyrics:
I've been waitin' for my dreams
To turn into something I could believe in
And lookin' for that magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it
Until I let go, gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm comin' alive, body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life
Holdin' onto things that vanished into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm risin' from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed

Was there all along within' my reach
As close as the beat of my heart
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
The time of my life
And I'm out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
Keeping my feet on the ground
Arms open wide, face to the sun
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life

They said this day wouldn't come, we refused to run
We've only just begun, you'll find us chasing the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun
You'll find us chasing the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun

We're gonna play in the dark till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming, I will never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

Artist: Rihanna
Lyrics:
Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, a standing ovation
Ooh, whoa, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
But, now, it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Oh, oh
Grab your clothes and get gone (Get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (Come on)
Talkin' 'bout "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like the re-run
Please, what else is on? (Oh, oh)
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not (Mmm)
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
But, now, it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (Goes to you)
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation

But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
Now, it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now

Lyrics:
If I don't say this now, I will surely break
As I'm leaving the one I wanna take
Forgive the urgency, but hurry up and wait
My heart has started to separate
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you
There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
Will you, won't you be the one I'll always know?
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
You're the only one who knows, you slow it down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you
And I'll look after you
If ever there was a doubt
My love, she leans into me
This most assuredly counts
She says most assuredly

Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you
After you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
It's always have and never hold
You've begun to feel like home
What's mine is yours to leave or take
What's mine is yours to make your own
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby

Name: Tears Dry on Their Own
Artist: Amy Winehouse
Lyrics:
All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry

I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause
Give me that thing that I love (
I'll turn the lights out

Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (
Make it real loud

I've overheard your theory, "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

When it's each other we despise

Nothin' that I write can make me feel good

Neon lights surroundin' me, I indulge in luxury
Everything I do is wrong, 'cept for when I hit the bong
Hit the bong, hit the bo—, feel good
Feelin' shitty in my bed, didn't take my fuckin' meds
Hyperpop up in my ears, everything just disappears
Don't wanna be someone else, just don't wanna hate myself
I just don't wanna hate myself, instead I wanna feel good
I'm on a sugar crash, I ain't got no fuckin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath, cut my fuckin' brain in half
I'm not lonely, just a bit tired of this fuckin' shit
Nothin' that I write can make me feel good

Lyrics:
Lightning strike
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Just say so
How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down

Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again

Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak
It's heartbreak warfare

Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her

You know it's not the same as it was

Wishing these memories would fade, they never do

As if it was really that easy for me to get over you
I just need time
Snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
I'm writin' a song
Said, "This is the last one"
How many last songs are left? I'm losing count
Since June 22nd
My heart's been on fire
I've been spendin' my nights in the rain tryin' to put it out

So I'm snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
Oh-woah
'Cause I might snap
Oh-woah
And if one more person says, "You should get over it"
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap, snap, snap
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap
Snappin' one, two
Where are you? (Where are you?)
You're still in my heart (Still in my heart)
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore (Need you here anymore)
Get out of my heart

'Cause I might sna—, I might snap (Oh-woah)
'Cause I might sna—, I might snap (Oh-woah)

Lyrics:
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life

Lyrics:
It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I've found the love of my life
Passes, things get more comfortable
Everything is going right
And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
And we used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain
Remember Harbor Boulevard?
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown
We have changed, but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah, I know we're cool

And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hangin' out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
C-cool, uh-uh, I know we're cool, uh-uh
I-I know we're cool
C-cool, yeah, I know we're cool
Me and you

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
[Verse 1: Katy Perry &
Snoop Dogg

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees (
Yeah

The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (
What?
At us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Sex (Sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight

But I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long

'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor

Da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray)
I could break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Far away (I will)
And break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun (Into the sun)
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Break away
Break away

Name: You Are Young
Artist: Keane
Lyrics:
Fearful child have faith in brighter days
Stay home 'til this darkness fades away
Lie still beside me
I'll hold you now, I'll hold you forever
Winter's hand will freeze your heart again
Doors will close, no time to start again
Nothing is given
Except the ties that hold us together
Lay down your load
Cause every day it's gonna grow
And bask in the sunshine
Try to pay no mind, try to pay no mind at all
To all the things that you don't know
You've got time to realize
You're shielded by the hands of love
Cause you are young
Fading light may make a fool of me
Courage fails, strengths slip away from me
Lie still beside me
And hold me now, and hold me forever

Lay down your load
Cause every day it's gonna grow
These days are sacred
Hey now, don't be scared, baby, don't be scared at all
Of all the things that you don't know
You've got time to realize
You're shielded by the hands of love
Cause you are young
You've got time, you've got to try
To bring some good into this world
Cause you are young
Cause you are young
Oh-oh-oh
Cause you are young

Artist: Avicii
Lyrics:
(Hey) Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day my father he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)

(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
When thunderclouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are"
One day my father he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)

"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
