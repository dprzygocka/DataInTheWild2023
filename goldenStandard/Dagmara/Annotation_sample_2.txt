I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful (Somethin' beautiful)
Somethin' beautiful (Somethin' beautiful)
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle (Oh)
On a miracle (Oh)
Say, go through the darkest of days

Driving the edge of a knife

mood: negative
Lyrics:
Walking out the door this morning wondering what it is that's going on with you, on with you
Thinking of a way to say I'm sorry for something that I'm not sure I'd do, sure I'd do
So come on baby let me in and show me what this really is cause
Something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
What can I do to make you say, "come back to me"?
Hoping for a moment that I turn around and you'll be coming after me, after me
Cause all that I can say is that it's obvious, it's obvious you're all I see, all I see
So come on baby let me in and show me what this really is about
Cause I can't read you
Come on baby let me in and show me what this really is cause
Something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
What can I do to make you say, "come back to me"?
Come back to me

And I'll be here in the morning if you say "stay", if you say "stay" to me, oh
And I'll be here in the morning if you say "stay", if you say "stay" to me, oh oh
And I'll be here in the morning if you say "stay", if you say "stay" to me, oh
Something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
What can I do to make you say, "come back to me"?

What did I do to make you say that to me?

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Find light in the beautiful sea

You and I, you and I, we're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy

Item 6:
Name: Life For Rent
Artist: Dido
mood: negative
Lyrics:
I haven't ever really found a place that I call home
I never stick around quite long enough to make it
I apologise that once again I'm not in love
But it's not as if I mind that your heart ain't exactly breaking
It's just a thought, only a thought
But if my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
I've always thought that I would love to live by the sea
To travel the world alone and live more simply
I have no idea what's happened to that dream
'Cause there's really nothing left here to stop me
It's just a thought, only a thought
If my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
If my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine

While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down
While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try
Well, how can I say I'm alive?
If my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
If my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine

Item 8:
Name: World's Smallest Violin
Artist: AJR
mood: negative
Lyrics:
My grandpa fought in World War II
He was such a noble dude
I can't even finish school
Missed my mom and left too soon
His dad was a fireman
Who fought fires so violent
I think I bored my therapist
While playing him my violin
(Oh my god) That's so insane
(Oh my god) That's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad (One, two, three, four)
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon (That's right, that's right)
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you

My grandpa fought in World War II
And he was such a noble dude
Man, I feel like such a fool
I got so much left to prove
All my friends have vaping friends
They'rе so good at making friends
I'm so scared of caving in
Is that entеrtaining yet?
(Oh my god) That's so insane
(Oh my god) That's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad (One, two, three, four)
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon (That's right, that's right)
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you

Somewhere in the universe
Somewhere someone's got it worse
Wish that made it easier
Wish I didn't feel the hurt
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
All up and down a city street
While tryna put my mind at ease
Like finishing this melody
This feels like a necessity
So this could be the death of me
Or maybe just a better me
Now, come in with the timpanis
And take a shot of Hennessy
I know I'm not there mentally
But you could be the remedy
So let me play my violin for you

Item 9:
Name: Amnesia
Artist: 5 Seconds of Summer
mood: negative
Lyrics:
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doin' fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely, even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
[Chorus: All,
Luke
]
I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
[Verse 2: Calum,
Calum & Luke
]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still livin' in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
[Bridge: Luke & Ashton,
Luke
]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say
[Chorus: All,
Luke
]
I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all

mood: negative
Lyrics:
You, you know how to get me so low
My heart had a crash when we spoke
I can't fix what you broke
And you, you always have a reason
Again and again, this feelin'
Why do I give in?
And I always was, and always was one for cryin'
I always was one for tears
The sun's getting cold, it's snowin'
Looks like an early winter for us
Looks like an early winter for us
An early winter
Oh, I need you to turn me over
It's sad the map of the world is on you
The moon gravitates around you
The seasons escape you
And I always was, and always was one for cryin'
I always was one for tears
No, I never was, and never was one for lyin'
You lied to me all these years

The sun's getting cold, it's snowin'
Looks like an early winter for us
Looks like an early winter for us
An early winter
Oh, I need you to turn me over
Why?
Why do you act so stupid?
Why?
You know that I'm always right
It looks like an early winter for us
It hurts and I can't remember sunlight
An early winter for us
The leaves are changing color for us
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
Starting over, and over, and over again
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
Starting over, and over, and over again
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
(Well, it looks like an early winter for us)
Starting over, and over, and over again
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
Starting over, and over, and over again
(Well, it looks like an early winter for us)

Item 14:
Name: Believing
Artist: The Calling
mood: positive
Lyrics:
I'm one man to make a difference
I'm one soul all persistence
In a dark world, just trying to make things right
Chances we weren't given
Any heroes, and our decision
Is to stand up and fight for ourselves
To be free
Is all we want to be
When everything seems so far out of reach
But I know, no matter where we go
I'll never stop believing in me
Woke up bent and broken
Just to find that fate has spoken
And I call out I call out for change
For every moment that remains
For every sinking stone to find it's place
Long before they're washed away
We've been waiting for too long
We've been giving in to wrong
And we've been broken to pieces one by one

We're gonna know
We're gonna know
When the moment comes

The sun goes down, the stars come out

You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me
Turn the lights out now
Now, I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came, I'm glad you came

You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me
Turn the lights out now
Now, I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make

Artist: Bruno Mars
mood: negative
Lyrics:
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that
I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man

mood: positive
Lyrics:
Don't look at me
Mm, mm
Oh
Ooh, oh, mm
Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain
I'm so ashamed
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you
down, oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today
No matter what we do
(No matter what we do)
No matter what we say
(No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune
(Yeah)
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go
(And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
(The sun will always, always shine)
And tomorrow we might wake on the other side
'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

Ooh-oh-oh, yeah
Don't you bring me down today
Yeah, ooh
Don't you bring me down
Ooh, today

Name: Bleeding Love
Artist: Leona Lewis
mood: negative
Lyrics:
Hey
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
But somethin' happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy
Ooh, yeah
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Mm, yeah
Tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
But nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open, mmh

And it's drainin' all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see
I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love (You)
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love (You)
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love (Oh, keep bleeding love)
Keep bleedin' (I keep)
Keep, keep bleeding love
Ooh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love

I used to wanna be
Living like there's only me
But now I spend my time
Thinking 'bout a way to get you off my mind
(Yeah, you!)
I used to be so tough
Never really gave enough
And then you caught my eye
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike
(Yeah, you!)
Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground I'm on, it keeps shaking
Oh-oh-oh, now!
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
'Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah

Looking for a way that I can see your face

I've got your photograph
But, baby, I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this
(Yeah, you!)
Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground I'm on, it keeps shaking
Oh-oh-oh, now!
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah

Name: Name
Artist: The Goo Goo Dolls
mood: neutral
Lyrics:
And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Get tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away
And now we're grown-up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one, that's a shame
You could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name
And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
And did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are?
You grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
Then reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

And I won't tell 'em your name
Hmm, mmm-hmm
And I won't tell 'em your name
Oh!
I think about you all the time
But I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are, come back down
And I won't tell 'em your name

Artist: Ryan Star
mood: positive
Lyrics:
She is fine most of the time
She takes her days with a smile
Moves like a dancer in light
Spinning around to the sound
But sometimes, she falls down
Breathe, just breathe
Take the world off your shoulders and put it on me
Breathe, just breathe
Let the life that you live be all that you need
She likes New York at night
She dreams of running away
Shine on, bright like the sun
When even the sky turns gray
I need you to hear me say
I need you to hear me say
Breathe, just breathe
Take the world off your shoulders, put it on me
Breathe, just breathe
Let the life that you live be all that you need

Let go of the fear, let go of the doubt
Let go of the ones who try to put you down
You're gonna be fine, don't hold it inside
If you hurt right now, then let it all come out
Breathe, just breathe
Take the world off your shoulders, put it on me
Breathe, just breathe
Let the life that you live be all that you need
Breathe, just breathe
Take the world off your shoulders, put it on me
Breathe, just breathe
Let the life that you live be all that you need
Let go of the fear, let go of the doubt
Let the life that you live be all that you need
Let go of the fear, let go of the doubt
Take the world off your shoulders, put it on me

mood: positive
Lyrics:
We're both looking for something
We've been afraid to find
It's easier to be broken
It's easier to hide
Looking at you, holding my breath
For once in my life, I'm scared to death
I'm taking a chance, letting you inside
We're feeling alive all over again
As deep as the sky, under my skin
Like being in love, she says, for the first time
Well, maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right
Wherever I belong with you tonight
Like being in love, to feel for the first time
The world that I see inside you
Waiting to come to life
Waking me up to dreaming
Reality in your eyes
Looking at you, holding my breath
For once in my life, I'm scared to death
I'm taking a chance, letting you inside

We're feeling alive all over again
As deep as the sky, under my skin
Like being in love, she says, for the first time
Well, maybe I'm wrong but I'm feeling right
Wherever I belong with you tonight
Like being in love, to feel for the first time
(For the first time, for the first time)
We're crashing into
Into the unknown
We're lost in this
But it feels like home
Feeling alive all over again
As deep as the sky that's under my skin
Like being in love, she says, for the first time
Well, maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right
Wherever I belong with you tonight
Like being in love, to feel for the first time
(For the first time, for the first time)
Like being in love, she says, for the first time
(For the first time, for the first time)
Like being in love, to feel for the first time

Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways
I was into you, but I'm ovеr it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so lеt me spell it out
A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
A-B-C-D-E, F you
You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say, you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me
I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
A-B-C-D-E, F off (F off)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

That you belong with me
You might think I don't look
But deep inside in the corner of my mind
I'm attached to you
Mmmm
I'm weak, it's true
'Cause I'm afraid to know the answer
Do you want me too?
'Cause my heart keeps falling faster
I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing that's true
So I will not hide
It's time to try anything to be with you
All my life I've waited
This is true
You don't know what you do
Everytime you walk into the room
I'm afraid to move

I'm weak, it's true
I'm just scared to know the ending
Do you see me too?
Do you even know you met me?
I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing that's true
So I will not hide
It's time to try anything to be with you
All my life I've waited

You held my hand and walked me home, I know
Why you gave me that kiss
It was somethin' like this and made me go, "Oh, oh"
You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears
Why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust
Did I not tell you
That I'm not like that girl?
The one who gives it all away, yeah, oh
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you
This time?
Did you think that it was something I was gonna do
And cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah
Don't think that your charm
And the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants
I'll have to kick your ass to make you never forget
I'm gonna ask you to stop
I thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset (Really upset)
So get outta my head, get off of my bed
Yeah, that's what I said

Did I not tell you
That I'm not like that girl?
The one who throws it all away
Did you think that I was gonna to give it up to you

Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah
This guilt trip that you put me on
Won't mess me up, I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you
This time?
Did you think that it was something I was gonna do

Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah

Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge

Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)

Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)

My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)

Never really said too much
Afraid it wouldn't be enough
Just try to keep my spirits up when there's no point in grievin'
Doesn't matter anyway
Words could never make me stay
Words will never take my place when you know I'm leavin'
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when it's late at night you can look inside
You won't feel so alone
You know we've been down that road
What seems a thousand times before
My back to a closing door and my eyes to the seasons
That roll out underneath my heels
And you don't know how bad it feels
Leave the only one that I have ever believed in

Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when it's late at night you can look inside
You won't feel so alone
Oh yeah...
Sometimes it feels like we've run out of luck
When the signal keeps on breaking up
When the wires cross in my brain
You'll start my heart again
When I come along, yeah
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when it's late at night you can look inside
You won't feel so alone

Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when it's late at night you can look inside
You won't feel so alone

It's always times like these when I think of you

But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Name: The Reason
Artist: Hoobastank
mood: neutral
Lyrics:
I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with every day
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
I've found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you

Item 37:
Name: Sleep All Day
Artist: Jason Mraz
mood: negative
Lyrics:
Well, his after moan though cries oh no
He, he's building up a shine, but he takes it slow
And he knows it time to make a change here in time to get away
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reason
Oh time to end the pain
But he sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over
But why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over?
She said a "What would your mother think of all this?
How would your father react, oh Lord
Would he take it all back what have they done?
The way they said, "Take it, take it "
And he said "Make it with your own two hands"
That was my old man
And he said, "If all is grounded
You should go make a mountain out of air"
Oh, what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
Oh, recalling of the while we used to drive and jive here and there
Going nowhere but for us, nowhere but the two of us
And we knew it was time to take a chance here
And time to compromise our lives just a little while

And it was time for all the wrong
And lonely lonesome reasons
But time is often on my side
I've gonna give it to you tonight
And we sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over
But why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day
We sleep all, we sleep all day over
And over, over and over again?
And as time goes by, we get a little bit tired
Of waking and baked another Marlboro mile wide
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in the hot summer sun
To swim beneath over outside
Still they've reading between the lines
But they remember the part in the Hallmark card
Where they read about the dreams and are reaching for the stars
To hold on a little bit closer to
And they knew it was time, time to take and take love
Time to a chance here, time to compromise, to occupy their lives
And it was time for all the wrong reasons
Oh, but all time is often on my side, but I give it to you, oh boy

Sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over
So why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over? (Over)
She said a "What would your mother think of all this
How would your father react, oh Lord
Would he take it all back what have they done
The way they said, "Take it, take it "
And he said "Make it, don't break it with your own two hands"
Said that was my old man and he said
"If all, all is grounded then you should go make a mountain out of air"
And love go make a mountain, go on and on and on and on
And you should go on make a mountain out of
And hey, love go on and go on and go on and
Go on and make a mountain and go on and make a mountain
Go on, oh you should go on and make a mountain out of air
