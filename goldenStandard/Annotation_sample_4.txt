Item 1:
Name: Firework
Artist: Katy Perry
Lyrics:
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

"Boom, boom, boom"
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it throu-ou-ough
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe,"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
"Boom, boom, boom"
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
"Boom, boom, boom"
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Item 3:
Name: You're Beautiful
Artist: James Blunt
Lyrics:
My life is brilliant
My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
Yeah, she caught my eye
As I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was
Fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
Ba, la, la, na
Ba, la, la, na
Ba, la, la, na, na
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you

Item 4:
Name: Mockingbird
Artist: Eminem
Lyrics:
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it
?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat,
don't fuck with Dad!
(Haha)

Item 5:
Name: You Only Live Once
Artist: The Strokes
Lyrics:
Some people think they're always right
Others are quiet and uptight
Others, they seem so very nice-nice-nice-nice, oh
Inside they might feel sad and wrong, oh no
Twenty-nine different attributes
Only seven that you like, oh
Twenty ways to see the world, oh
And twenty ways to start a fight, oh
Oh, don't, don't, don't get up!
I can't see the sunshine
I'll be waiting for you, baby
'Cause I'm through
Sit me down!
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you
Oh, men don't notice what they got
Oh, women think of that a lot
One thousand ways to please your man, oh
Not even one requires a plan, I know
And countless odd religions too
It doesn't matter which you choose, oh no
One stubborn way to turn your back, oh
This I've tried and now refuse, oh

Oh, don't, don't, don't get up!
I can't see the sunshine
Whoa, I'll be waiting for you, baby
'Cause I'm through
Sit me down!
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you, alright
Shut me up
Shut me up
And I'll get along with you

Item 6:
Name: Break Free
Artist: Ariana Grande
Lyrics:
If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
No more, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams, it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Ooh, baby
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is (This is) the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

Item 8:
Name: The Only Exception
Artist: Paramore
Lyrics:
When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing

Item 9:
Name: Save You
Artist: Simple Plan
Lyrics:
Take a breath
I pull myself together
Just another step
Until I reach the door
You'll never know the way it tears me up inside to see you
(Oh, oh) I wish that I could tell you something
(Oh, oh) To take it all away
Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know
When I hear your voice
It's drowning in a whisper
It's just skin and bones
There's nothing left to take
And no matter what I do, I can't make you feel better
(Oh, oh) If only I could find the answer
(Oh, oh) To help me understand

Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know
That if you fall, stumble down
I'll pick you up off the ground
If you lose faith in you
I'll give you strength to pull through
Tell me you won't give up 'cause I'll be waiting if you fall
You know, I'll be there for you
(Oh, oh) If only I could find the answer
(Oh, oh) To take it all away
Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever I want you to know

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wish I could save you
I want you to know
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wish I could save you

Name: Walking On a Dream
Artist: Empire of the Sun
Lyrics:
Walking on a dream
How can I explain?
Talking to myself
Will I see again?
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill,
searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one
Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minute's working over time
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill,
searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one
Catch me, I'm falling down
Catch me, I'm falling down
Don't stop, just keep going on
I'm your shoulder, lean upon
So come on, deliver from inside
All we got is tonight, that is right 'till first light
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one

Name: Bad Blood
Artist: Taylor Swift
Lyrics:
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're comin' my way, just don't
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (Hey)
You say sorry just for show (Hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Hey), mmm
If you love like that, blood runs cold

Item 16:
Name: Bad Day
Artist: Daniel Powter
Lyrics:
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on
Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Will you need a blue sky holiday?
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
(Ooh, a holiday)
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you're like
And how does it feel?
One more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Had a bad day (Ah)
Had a bad day (Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Had a bad day (Ah)

Item 17:
Name: Stressed Out
Artist: ​twenty one pilots
Lyrics:
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think

When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face

When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah

Lyrics:
(Last night, all I think about is you)
(
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
)
(Don't want, baby, think about you)
(You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly
un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Name: Again
Artist: Lenny Kravitz
Lyrics:
I've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Know that you are walking right through my door
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
A sacred gift of heaven
For better worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Until you cried, never
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?

At every time I've always known
That you were there
Upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I longed for you
My love forever
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

Item 22:
Name: Photograph
Artist: Nickelback
Lyrics:
Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
Every time I do, it makes me

Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city

Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back
I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes, tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs, pullin' up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy

Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no

Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are linin' up, 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talkin' 'bout everybody gettin' crunk, crunk, boys try to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk
No-now we go until they kick us out, out or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down, po-po shut us down
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh

My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me
With my hands up, you got me now
You got that sound, yeah, you got me

My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me
With my hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up

Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in

Name: Wherever You Will Go
Artist: The Calling
Lyrics:
So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love
I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go

Artist: Ghost
Lyrics:
We were speeding together down the dark avenues
But besides all the stardom, all we got was blues
But through all the sorrow, we've been riding high
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you go
We were scanning the cities, rocking to pay their dues
But besides all the glamour, all we got was bruised
But through all the sorrow, we've been riding high
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you go
You go down just like Holy Mary,
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another bloody Mary,
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
If you choose to run away with me, I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that
We were searching for reasons to play by the rules
But we quickly found out it was just for fools
Now through all the sorrow, we'll be riding high
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you go
You go down just like Holy Mary,
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another bloody Mary,
Mary on a, Mary on a...

You go down just like Holy Mary,
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Your beauty never ever scared me,
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
If you choose to run away with me, I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that

(Mary on a, Mary on a cross) Nothing wrong with that

You said bye bye bye bye bye goodbye
Well, I don't want to be with you tonight

Do you understand my monologue?
These are the words of the popstars
And these are the words of the unsophisticated money machines
For the killers of rock and roll
Hey digital, you're nothing but a bitch on the strings
You'll be back milking cows before you cash the check
I'll just wait around 'till you fade away like the rest
Like the best of the best
Do you understand my monologue?
These are the words of the popstars
And these are the words of the unsophisticated money machines
For the killers of rock and roll

Name: 21 Guns
Artist: Green Day
Lyrics:
Do you know what's worth fightin' for
When it's not worth dyin' for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocatin'?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms, into the sky
You and I
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms, into the sky
You and I
Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?
When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Somethin' inside this heart has died
You're in ruins
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms, into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms, into the sky
You and I

Lyrics:
I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river, and it made me complete
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go?

Name: A Bad Dream
Artist: Keane
Lyrics:
Why do I have to fly
Over every town up and down the line?
I'll die in the clouds above
And you that I defend I do not love
I wake up, it's a bad dream
No one on my side
I was fighting
But I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Where will I meet my fate?
Baby, I'm a man; I was born to hate
And when will I meet my end?
In a better time you could be my friend
I wake up, it's a bad dream
No one on my side
I was fighting
But I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Wouldn't mind it
If you were by my side
But you're long gone
Yeah, you're long gone now

Yeah
Where do we go?
I don't even know
My strange old face
I've been thinking about those days
I've been thinking about those days
Ooh
I wake up, it's a bad dream
No one on my side
I was fighting
But I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Wouldn't mind it if you were by my side
But you're long gone
Yeah, you're long gone now
Yeah

Item 34:
Name: Wild Heart
Artist: The Vamps
Lyrics:
I was walking away
But she's so beautiful it made me stay
I don't know her name
But I'm hoping she might feel the same
So here I go again
She got my heart again
Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Stay here, my dear
Feels like I've been standing right here for years
My mind's beat up
Tell me that you feel this, and I won't give up
I won't give up
Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart

[Bridge: Brad Simpson and
Connor Ball
]
And I know it's late, I know it's cold
But come right here, I swear I'll never let you go
The way you move it's wonderful
Let's do it now, cause one day we'll both be old
Oh, whoa, oh
Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I've got a wild heart

Item 36:
Name: Speed of Sound
Artist: Coldplay
Lyrics:
How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found (Got found)
And birds go flyin' at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flyin' from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flyin' at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flyin' from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it
Then you'll understand
All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent
(Ooh)

Birds go flyin' at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flyin' from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it
Then you'll understand

Item 37:
Name: No Roots
Artist: Alice Merton
Lyrics:
I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I hope I won't forget to find them
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
I build a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots

I like standing still but that's just a wishful plan
Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots

I like digging holes, hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I won't forget to find them
I like digging holes, hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I won't forget to find them
I've got no roots
No roots
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
(No!)

Name: Bloody Mary
Artist: Lady Gaga
Lyrics:
Money
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see (See)
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary
Love

We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the aggro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountaintops in Paris, cold
J'veux pas mourir toute seule
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see (See)
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary
Love

Item 39:
Name: Counting Stars
Artist: OneRepublic
Lyrics:
Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars"
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars
I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
I feel something so right doin' the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars"

I feel your love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that downs me makes me wanna fly
Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars"

Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be counting stars"
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned

Item 40:
Name: Come Back Down
Artist: Lifehouse
Lyrics:
Staring right back in the face
A memory can't be erased
I know, because I tried
Start to feel the emptiness
And everything I'm gonna miss
I know, that I can't hide
All this time is passing by
I think it's time to just move on
When you come back down
If you land on your feet
I hope you find a way to make it back to me
When you come around
I'll be there for you
Don't have to be alone with what you're going through
Start to breathe and fake a smile
It's all the same after a while
I know, that you are tired
Carrying the ones you lost
A picture frame with all the thoughts
I know, you hold inside
I hope that you can find your way back
To the place where you belong

You're coming back down
You say you feel lost can I help you find it
When you come around
From time to time we all are blinded
You're coming back down
You don't have to tell me what you're feeling
I know what you're going through
I won't be the one that lets go of you
